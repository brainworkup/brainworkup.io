abstract: First-episode schizophrenia (FES) spectrum disorders are associated with
  pronounced cognitive dysfunction across all domains. However, less is known about
  the course of cognitive functioning, following the first presentation of psychosis,
  and the relationship of cognition to clinical course during initial treatment. The
  present longitudinal study examined the magnitude of neurocognitive impairment,
  using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, in patients experiencing their first
  episode of psychosis at baseline and after 12 weeks of randomized antipsychotic
  treatment with either aripiprazole or risperidone. At baseline, FES patients evidenced
  marked impairments in cognitive functioning. Notably, performance on the mazes task
  of planning and reasoning significantly predicted the likelihood of meeting stringent
  criteria for positive symptom remission during the first 12 weeks of the trial.
  Performance on indices of general cognitive function, working memory, and verbal
  learning improved over time, but these improvements were mediated by improvements
  in both positive and negative symptoms. We did not detect any differential effects
  of antipsychotic medication assignment (aripiprazole vs risperidone) on cognitive
  functioning. Our results suggest that a brief paper-and-pencil measure reflecting
  planning/reasoning abilities may index responsivity to antipsychotic medication.
  However, improvements in cognitive functioning over time were related to clinical
  symptom improvement, reflecting \"pseudospecificity.\"
