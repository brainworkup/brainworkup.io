abstract: Susceptibility to schizophrenia is inversely correlated with general cognitive
  ability at both the phenotypic and the genetic level. Paradoxically, a modest but
  consistent positive genetic correlation has been reported between schizophrenia
  and educational attainment, despite the strong positive genetic correlation between
  cognitive ability and educational attainment. Here we leverage published genome-wide
  association studies (GWASs) in cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia to
  parse biological mechanisms underlying these results. Association analysis based
  on subsets (ASSET), a pleiotropic meta-analytic technique, allowed jointly associated
  loci to be identified and characterized. Specifically, we identified subsets of
  variants associated in the expected (\"concordant\") direction across all three
  phenotypes (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia, lower cognitive ability, and lower
  educational attainment); these were contrasted with variants that demonstrated the
  counterintuitive (\"discordant\") relationship between education and schizophrenia
  (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia and higher educational attainment). ASSET
  analysis revealed 235 independent loci associated with cognitive ability, education,
  and/or schizophrenia at p  textless 5 × 10-8. Pleiotropic analysis successfully
  identified more than 100 loci that were not significant in the input GWASs. Many
  of these have been validated by larger, more recent single-phenotype GWASs. Leveraging
  the joint genetic correlations of cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia,
  we were able to dissociate two distinct biological mechanisms-early neurodevelopmental
  pathways that characterize concordant allelic variation and adulthood synaptic pruning
  pathways-that were linked to the paradoxical positive genetic association between
  education and schizophrenia. Furthermore, genetic correlation analyses revealed
  that these mechanisms contribute not only to the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia
  but also to the broader biological dimensions implicated in both general health
  outcomes and psychiatric illness.
