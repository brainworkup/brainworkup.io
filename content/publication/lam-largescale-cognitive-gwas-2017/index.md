abstract: "Here, we present a large (n = 107,207) genome-wide association study (GWAS)\
  \ of general cognitive ability (``g''), further enhanced by combining results with\
  \ a large-scale GWAS of educational attainment. We identified 70 independent genomic\
  \ loci associated with general cognitive ability. Results showed significant enrichment\
  \ for genes causing Mendelian disorders with an intellectual disability phenotype.\
  \ Competitive pathway analysis implicated the biological processes of neurogenesis\
  \ and synaptic regulation, as well as the gene targets of two pharmacologic agents:\
  \ cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and LY97241, a potassium channel\
  \ inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide and epigenome-wide analysis revealed that the implicated\
  \ loci were enriched for genes expressed across all brain regions (most strongly\
  \ in the cerebellum). Enrichment was exclusive to genes expressed in neurons but\
  \ not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Finally, we report genetic correlations between\
  \ cognitive ability and disparate phenotypes including psychiatric disorders, several\
  \ autoimmune disorders, longevity, and maternal age at first birth. Lam et al. conduct\
  \ a large-scale genome-wide association study of cognitive ability, identifying\
  \ 70 associated loci. Results provide biological insights into the molecular basis\
  \ of individual differences in cognitive ability, as well as their relationship\
  \ to psychiatric and other health-relevant phenotypes."
