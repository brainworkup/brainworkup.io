abstract: Here we provide novel convergent evidence across three independent cohorts
  of healthy adults (n = 531), demonstrating that a common polymorphism in the gene
  encoding the $Î±$2 subunit of neuronal voltage-gated type II sodium channels (SCN2A)
  predicts human general cognitive ability or \"g.\" Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate
  that the minor T allele of a common polymorphism (rs10174400) in SCN2A is associated
  with significantly higher \"g\" independent of gender and age. We further demonstrate
  using resting-state fMRI data from our discovery cohort (n = 236) that this genetic
  advantage may be mediated by increased capacity for information processing between
  the dorsolateral pFC and dorsal ACC, which support higher cognitive functions. Collectively,
  these findings fill a gap in our understanding of the genetics of general cognitive
  ability and highlight a specific neural mechanism through which a common polymorphism
  shapes interindividual variation in \"g.\"
