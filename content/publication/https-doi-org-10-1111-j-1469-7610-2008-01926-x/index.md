abstract: 'Background: This study examined neuropsychological functioning in a longitudinal
  sample of adolescents/young adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
  (ADHD) and controls as a function of the persistence of ADHD. We hypothesized that
  measures of executive processes would parallel adolescent clinical status, with
  ADHD-persisters, but not remitters, differing significantly from controls. In contrast,
  persisters and remitters were hypothesized to perform similarly, and different from
  controls, on tasks requiring less effortful processing. Methods: Ninety-eight participants
  diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were reevaluated approximately 10 years later.
  Eighty-five never-ADHD controls similar in age, IQ, and sex distribution served
  as a comparison group. Participants were administered a psychiatric interview and
  neuropsychological test battery. Results: Those with childhood ADHD demonstrated
  broad neuropsychological deficits relative to controls. When the group with childhood
  ADHD was subdivided based on adolescent ADHD status, compared to controls, both
  persisters and remitters showed deficient perceptual sensitivity and response variability,
  and increased ankle movements recorded by a solid-state actigraph. Only persisters
  differed from controls on several measures of more effortful executive processes.
  Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary support to the hypothesis that ADHD is
  associated with early-appearing and enduring subcortical dysfunction, while recovery
  over the course of development is associated with improvements in executive control
  functions.'
