abstract: 'The complex nature of human cognition has resulted in cognitive genomics
  lagging behind many other fields in terms of gene discovery using genome-wide association
  study (GWAS) methods. In an attempt to overcome these barriers, the current study
  utilized GWAS meta-analysis to examine the association of common genetic variation
  ($∼$8M single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with minor allele frequency $≥slant$
  1%) to general cognitive function in a sample of 35 298 healthy individuals of European
  ancestry across 24 cohorts in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT). In addition,
  we utilized individual SNP lookups and polygenic score analyses to identify genetic
  overlap with other relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes. Our primary GWAS meta-analysis
  identified two novel SNP loci (top SNPs: rs76114856 in the CENPO gene on chromosome
  2 and rs6669072 near LOC105378853 on chromosome 1) associated with cognitive performance
  at the genome-wide significance level (P o 5 × 10 - 8'
