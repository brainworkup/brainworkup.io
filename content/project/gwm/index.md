## Title

**GWAS of the RDoC Cognitive Systems Domain: Modeling the Latent Genetic Architecture of Working Memory**

## Description

This two-year study will use existing GWAS data from COGENT to investigate the latent molecular genetic architecture of working memory. Working memory is a core Construct of the RDoC Cognitive Systems Domain, defined as the active maintenance and flexible updating of goal/task relevant information in a form that has limited capacity and resists interference. Limited working memory capacity is a fundamental aspect of the cognitive impairments prevalent in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Most of the variability underlying differences in general working memory capacity can be traced back to inherited genetic factors. However, exactly how our DNA shapes the working memory system has yet to be established. As such, our objective is to identify the spectrum of genome-wide allelic variation underlying working memory – from individual loci to genes to polygenic risk scores to functional biological pathways – determined to be causal, not merely correlational, in relation to working memory performance.
